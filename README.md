# periodic_table_project
This is my submission for the freeCodeCamp Periodic Table Project from the Relational Databases course

Inside you will find a script I wrote to be able to do all of the sql requirements at once

How can I remove the trailing zeros from the freecodecamp periodic table project?

hopefully google finds this because that was frustrating to get working.
